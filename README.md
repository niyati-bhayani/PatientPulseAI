## Sentiment Analysis Model for Patient Reviews (Binary Classification)
### Overview
This repository contains a sentiment analysis model designed to analyze patient reviews and feedback. The model aims to evaluate patient sentiments and classify them as either positive or negative to provide insights for improving Patient Experience.

The model is based on BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a state-of-the-art language model, fine-tuned on patient review data to classify sentiments into two categories: positive and negative.

### Key Features
**BERT-based Sentiment Analysis:** Utilizes pre-trained BERT embeddings, fine-tuned on the healthcare domain for sentiment classification.

**Binary Classification:** Classifies sentiments into two categories: Positive or Negative.

**Patient Feedback Processing:** Processes raw patient reviews, cleans the text, and prepares it for sentiment classification.

### Data
The model is trained on a dataset of patient reviews, which may include:

Textual reviews written by patients.

Sentiment labels (Positive, Negative).

### Future Enhancements
Fine-tuning the model with more patient review data to improve performance.

Adding multi-language support for diverse patient populations.

Implementing real-time review processing for live systems.
